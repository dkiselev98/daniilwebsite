    <h1>Daniil Kiselev</h1>
      <p>I am a 21 year old film and television enthusiast currently working out of Universal Studios. It has taken a lot of dedication to get here, but the magic behind the making of my favorite movies and TV shows has drawn my interest since I was 12. Ever since, I have put in the time, resources, and effort necessary to educate myself in this vocation and establish the proper networking skills for success.</p>
      <p>After college I was able to successfully land a position as a production assistant on the live-to-tape TV set of <i>Home and Family</i> at Universal Studios. Starting out as a production assistant has been extremely beneficial in helping me to achieve a well-rounded career because it has given me the opportunity to understand every aspect of the business from the ground up. I have already expanded my knowledge of different set positions by using my breaks as a chance to learn new skills such as properly wrangling the cables for utility/grip positions.</p>
      <p>By working in both production and post-production, I have overseen the entire process involved as the production coordinator. In this position I assisted the CFO with scheduling, maintaining stages, and establishing good clientele relationships to ensure they were satisfied with our work at the facility and more inclined to bring other potential clients.</p>
      <p>Eventually, I would like to specialize in filming TV shows, but I am excited to strengthen my skills in cinematography and see where my next career opportunity will take me. </p>
